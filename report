# REPORT

## 1. Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to build a deep learning model for a classification problem developing a binary classifier using machine learning and neural networks to assist the nonprofit foundation, Alphabet Soup, in identifying applicants with the highest probability of success for funding. By leveraging the dataset's features, the goal is to create a tool that can accurately predict whether applicants, if funded by Alphabet Soup, will be successful in their ventures.The model aims to predict the target variable based on the input features. The analysis involves data preprocessing, compiling and training the model, and evaluating its performance.

## 2. Results

### - Data Preprocessing:

#### Target Variable: 
The model's target variable is the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column, which indicates if the model was succesful or not.

#### Feature Variables: 
 "APPLICATION_TYPE," "AFFILIATION," "CLASSIFICATION," "USE_CASE," "ORGANIZATION," "STATUS," "INCOME_AMT," "SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS," and "ASK_AMT" were the feature variables of this model. 

#### Variables to be Excluded: 
The "EIN" and "NAME" columns were omitted from the input data.

### - Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:
